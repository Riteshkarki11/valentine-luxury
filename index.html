    <p>
        You didn't just change my world —<br><br>
        I love being with you, walking beside you,<br>
        listening to you, mimicking you,<br>
        and then watching you make that cute face<br>
        that melts me every time.<br><br>
        You make me want to keep improving myself,<br>
        not out of pressure but out of love.<br><br>
        The laughter we share, the love we feel —<br>
        you complete me in a way<br><br>
        I never knew was possible.<br>
        listening to you, and seeing your cute smile.<br><br>
        Stop being so amazing, it's distracting.🫠<br>
        I love you so much ❤️
